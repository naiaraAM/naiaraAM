## ðŸš€ About Me
* I am an MSc Computer Science student at the University of Tartu, Estonia, with a background in BSc Computer Systems Engineering.

* My interest in IT is regarding cybersecurity, but also front-end. I have done 2 summer internships, one in Spain and another in Estonia.
* Out of uni, I am the webmaster of [ESN Santander](https://esnsantander.org/), a volunteer organisation. In my free time, I enjoy good music and coffee, football and reading.
